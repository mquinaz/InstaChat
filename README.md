# InstaChat

## Work in progress

Automatic NLP solution for Instagram using Python. First under settings in instagram we can export all data. This will generate a Json that can be converted into a CSV (https://data.page/json/csv). By analyzing the target responses and patterns we can define an intent json file with a general tag, and a list of patterns and responses string. Then running the training example with python3 we can train our model based on the intents file. Using python3 and we have to leave an instagram direct message open.
